## Structure

*   `data/`: Contains mock raw and cleaned data (e.g., similar to datasets from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) or [OpenAI's datasets](https://openai.com/blog/openai-datasets/)).
*   `knowledge_graph/`: Contains a mock knowledge graph (e.g., similar to [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/) or [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/)).
*   `models/`: Placeholder for a trained model (currently empty but could be replaced by an in-house model, or [Hugging Face models](https://huggingface.co/models)).
*   `rag/`: Implements Knowledge Graph Augmented Generation (KAG) and vector search systems (e.g., similar to [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/), [LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/), [FAISS](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss), [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/), [Vespa](https://vespa.ai/), or [Weaviate](https://weaviate.io/)).
*   `web_app/`: Contains the [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) web application (e.g., similar to a [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) or [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)-based service).
*   `observability/`: Implements basic metrics tracking (e.g., similar to [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) or [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/)).
*   `tests/`: Contains unit tests for various components of the application, ensuring code quality and reliability.
*   `vitalik_ai.py`: Generates tweets using [OpenAI](https://openai.com/).
*   `main.py`: The main application file.
*   `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python dependencies.
*   `.env`: Stores sensitive information (API keys). **Do not commit this file!**
*   `.gitignore`: Specifies files to ignore in Git.

## Setup

1.  Create a virtual environment: `python3 -m venv venv`
2.  Activate the virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate` (Linux/macOS) or `venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows)
3.  Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4.  Set the OpenAI API key in the `.env` file.
5.  Run the application: `flask --app web_app/app.py --debug run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=8080`

## Endpoints

*   `/`: Main page for querying the AI.
*   `/metrics`: Returns the query count (accessible from main.py if needed, but primarily for the web app).

**Important:** This is a mocked system and should not be used in production. For production deployment, consider the following:

## Production Considerations

To productionalize this MVP, consider the following enhancements:

1.  **Orchestration Pipelines:** Implement robust orchestration using tools like [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/), [Prefect](https://www.prefect.io/), or [Kubeflow Pipelines](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/pipelines/) to automate data collection, cleaning, knowledge graph creation, and model training.

2.  **Agentic Frameworks:** Integrate dedicated agentic frameworks such as [RD-Agent from Microsoft](https://rdagent.azurewebsites.net/), [AutoGen](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/), or [LangChain Agents](https://python.langchain.com/docs/introduction/) to manage the agent's behavior, memory, and tool usage more effectively.

3.  **Real-time Data Integration:** Replace the mock data collection with real-time data ingestion pipelines from sources like Twitter feeds, RSS feeds, or live APIs.

4.  **Enhanced Observability:** Implement comprehensive monitoring and logging using tools like [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/), [Grafana](https://grafana.com/), and [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) to track system performance, identify bottlenecks, and ensure reliability.

5.  **Scalability and Reliability:** Deploy the application on a scalable infrastructure like Kubernetes or a cloud-based serverless platform to handle increased traffic and ensure high availability.

6.  **Security:** Implement robust security measures, including input validation, authentication, and authorization, to protect against potential threats.

7.  **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** Set up a CI/CD pipeline to automate testing, building, and deployment of code changes.

By addressing these considerations, you can transform this MVP into a production-ready AI agent capable of delivering valuable insights and content.
